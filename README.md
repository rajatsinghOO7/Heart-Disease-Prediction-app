# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project! This repository provides a comprehensive guide to predicting heart disease using logistic regression. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. This project uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient features. Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks, which makes it well-suited for predicting the presence or absence of a disease.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this project, ensure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of logistic regression and binary classification
- Python 3.x installed
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found in the `data/` directory. The dataset contains various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. For this project, we use the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/heart-disease).

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:
- Loading the dataset
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing features

## Model Training

The logistic regression model is trained using Scikit-learn. Key steps include:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Fitting the logistic regression model to the training data
- Tuning hyperparameters (if applicable)

The model training scripts are located in the `model/` directory.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve

## Results

The results section provides an overview of the model's performance, including accuracy and other evaluation metrics. This section also includes a comparison of the model's predictions against actual values.

## Visualizations

Visualizations help in understanding the data and model performance. Included are:
- Histograms and scatter plots of features
- ROC Curve
- Confusion Matrix

## Conclusion

The logistic regression model demonstrates effectiveness in predicting heart disease based on the provided dataset. The results show how well the model performs and provides insights into the most significant features for prediction.

## FAQs

**Q: What is logistic regression?**
A: Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on input features.

**Q: How can I improve the model's performance?**
A: Consider feature engineering, feature selection, or trying different algorithms for comparison.
